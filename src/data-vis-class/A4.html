    <h2>Is the complaint system for police abuse of authority any good?</h2>

      <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

				<figcaption>
					The complaint filing system has been a huge success in New York over the years to prevent abuse of authority from the police. Over the first two decades of the 21st century, more and more people have been able to access the system and file complaints against the police. While an overwhelming majority of the complaints are found to be unsubstantiated, the increasing adoption of the system indicates that the system is working and that people are not afraid to file complaints against the police.

				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The use of green color to indicate a positive trend. Color is the first thing people notice in a visualization. So it sets the tone of what kind of affect the visualization is trying to have. In this case, the green gives a optimistic first glance. <em>Score: 1.5</em></li>
				<li>The use of dotted green arrow ending at a text box to guide the viewer to see the positive trend and the description. This is similar to above. The textbox gives more context as to what the positive trend means and why i is good. <em>Score: 1.5</em></li>
				<li>The pie chart of board decision on complaints from a year to give more context. It shows the viewer that while the complaints result in some action, the increasing trend of the complaints does not necessarily mean more substantiated complaints. I decided to combine 'unsubstantiated' and 'exonerated' into one single category of 'no action taken' to show bigger portion of complaints do not lead to any action. <em>Score: -1.</em></li>
				<li>Counting duplicate complaints. Complainants can file a single complaint with multiple allegations. And each allegation is a separate row in the table. I have decided to count the allegations as it has a much cleaner trend compared to counting complaints. <em>Score: -1</em></li>
			</ul>

      <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

      <figure class="figure">
				<img src="/images/vis-class/a4/against.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					NYPD is not taking the complaints from the citizens seriously leading ot the failure of the system. There are huge number of officers with multiple complainst against them, going to as high as 29. Officers who have been found guilty of serious misconduct multiple times are not being punished and are still on the force. Moreover, the policy change around 2012 gives more leeway to the police by pressing more lenienent charges even when the complaint has ben found substantiated. The system is not working and the police are not being held accountable for their actions.

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The use of red color to indicate provoke emotion. Similar to above, I use shade of red to evoke negative emotion from from the get go. <em>Score: 1.5</em></li>
				<li>Use of text of short blurbs to guide the viewer's thoughts. Given the graph is presented on its own without accompanying text (except for caption), I have put text help guide the viewer. <em>Score: 1.5</em></li>
				<li>Inclusion of the line charts at the top. I was debating whether or not to put it. I decided to go with it because it gives extra information about policy change which gives more leeway to the police. <em>Score: 1.5</em></li>
			</ul>

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>After some preliminary analysis of the data, I had in mind some ideas for what proposition to explore. But it was not as straightforward as I had thought it would be to look for evidence for both sides of the proposition. Most of the times the problem would be the fact that I already had a lens (either for or against the proposition) through which I was looking the data and it was very difficult to look and find satisfying evidence from the other perspective. In that process, often times I would be censoring myself from using any deceptive techniques either consciously by reminding myself that it is deceptive or unconsciously. It took a lot of time to get to a path which looked somewhat promising.</p>

	  <p>Looking at my visualization and the selection process I went through, I think it is not very clear if the choices I labelled above as deceptive are even deceptive. A lot of it is just selection- which I have done on both the visualizations. Both represent a selection out of tens of exploration I did. So it is not very clean separation between "acceptable" and "misleading" choices.</p>
